PCA3,-,Prostate Cancer,PROGENSA PCA3 Assay,Gen-Probe_ Inc.,P100033,N,63,amplification,PCA3_ PCA3 Gene_ Prostate Cancer Associated 3 Gene,prostate cancer,10283,8140 (adenocarcinoma_ NOS) for prostate primaries when the diagnosis is acinar,risk assesment,predisposition,urine,R and C,1,clinical use,NCT01024959,PMA,21405964,RetObs,The effectiveness of the PROGENSA PCA3 Assay has been demonstrated for use in conjunction with other patient information to aid in the decision for repeat biopsy in men 50 years of age or older who have had one or more previous negative prostate biopsies and for whom a repeat biopsy would be recommended by a urologist based on current standard of care_ before consideration of PROGENSA PCA3 Assay results.,PROGENSA PCA3 Assay,The PROGENSA PCA3 Assay is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test. The assay measures the concentration of prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) RNA molecules and calculates the ratio ofPCA3 RNA molecules to PSA RNA molecules (PCA3 Score) in post-digital rectal exam (DRE) first catch male urine specimens.
