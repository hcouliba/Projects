F015,UPKB:P38398,Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein gene (BRCA1),presence of BRCA1 mutation,predictive,blood (UN:0000178),NA,ovarian cancer (DOID:2394),BRACAnalysis CDxTM is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the qualitative detection and classification of variants in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes using genomic DNA obtained from whole blood specimens collected in EDTA. Single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Large deletions and duplications in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are detected using multiplex PCR. Results of the test are used as an aid in identifying ovarian cancer patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants eligible for treatment with LynparzaTM (olaparib) [FCTID:P140020],BRACAnalysis CDx ovarian cancer panel; NCT00753544
